# Autolib Car  Analysis - Hypothesis Testing

We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.
Our hypotheses for this project is:
- Null Hypothesis: The mean of Blue Cars taken on weekends is equal to the mean of Utilib Cars taken on weekends

μ1=μ2

- Alternative Hypothesis: The mean of Blue Cars taken on weekends is not equal to the mean of Utilib Cars taken on weekends

μ1≠μ2
